                started playing rocket league. good game! yeah im late to the party by a year or two, but that still means i can have fun with it still, right? probably not. oh well! ill talk about it anyways because im in class right now and i have to look like im doing something.<br><br>
                
                so i got it because my cousin jason came to my apartment from washington and i bought the game for us to play. i soon realized that we couldnt play online because i needed two PS-plus accounts. so we played against bots for like 4 hours. just so you know! bots are actually hard in that game! you dont even know! well you probably do because you might have played it. <br><br>
                
                im still really bad at the game, but i have enough fun with it that it keeps me coming back to play it more. all though, the people who play on the PC with me are pricks. they dont know how to be nice! i bumped into a dude like 2 times and he called me an ass. after that, anytime anything went wrong he would call me an ass again. this just keeps proving my theory of how PC players are just mean. <br><br>
                
                they think that just because they have a PC that they are better than everyone. and that i can never EVER have fun playing a video game on a PS4 or Xbox One. just like how you can never have fun doing anything ever unless you spend 5 thousand ducks (yes, ducks) on a PC that will be outdated in a month and you have to fight every game to play it on you machine. yes, PC's have better graphics. but i would rather put a game into a console and the game just works than crazy good graphics and framerate that i only notice once when i first load up the game and notice it for 15 whole seconds.
