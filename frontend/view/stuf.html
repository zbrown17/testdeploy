                    surprise surprise, someone is talking about VR! i got the samsung VR (virtual reality!) for christmas from my mom because shes awesome! and because i wouldnt shut up about it. nothing hotter than a 21 year old guy begging is mom for a christmas pressant (am i right, ladies?)<br><br>
                    anyway, i really love it! when i tell people about it they always say, "oh why would you get that? it sounds stupid." or something like that. but when i tell them that you can WATCH NETFLIX LAYING FLAT they all of a sudden jump on bored with me! and it may be the best thing ever to lay down and watch netflix and it be a massive screen with no chance of anyone getting in front of my precious daredevil's saving the day!<br><br>
                    there really are only a few things that i can complain about. and i honestly shouldn't complain at all because it's virtual reality, and i got it for free (kinda). but the first bad thing that comes to mind is that i fog up the screen when i breathe through my nose. now it is probably just something that happens to me, but as someone who likes to breathe, it's just a little annoying. another thing is that the display isnt the best resolution, but for it being a phone, i understand. and lastly, my phone over heats while im using it. i think there is a fix for it, but i just havent found it. mainly because i havent tried. <br><br>
                    honesly though, the gear VR is freaking amazing for the price and useability. i just shove my phone in it and im totaly out of this world and into my own world. plus, you get to watch youtube and netflix laying down in bed and looking straight up. its hard to complain about that in my book.<br><br>
                    10/10 would ask my mom for it again.
